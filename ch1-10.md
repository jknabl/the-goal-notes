# Chapters 1-10

## Introduction

"What I have attempted to show with this book is that no exceptional brainpower is needed to construct a new science or to expand on an existing one. What is needed is just the courage to face inconsistencies and to avoid running away from them just because 'that's the way it was always done.'" 
  * Perceive _reality_. Face inconsistencies. 

"I have also attempted to show in the book the meaning of education. I sincerely believe that the only way we can learn is through our deductive process. Presenting us with final conclusions is not a way that we learn."
  * Ineffective to reason from the particular (i.e. a summary) to the general. Go from the general to the particular

"As [people] think logically and consistently about their problems they are able to determine 'cause' and 'effect' relationships between their actions and the results. In the process they deduce some basic principles."

"We simply need to *look at reality* and *think logically and precisely* about what we see. The key ingredient is to have the courage to face inconsistencies between what we see and deduce and the way things are done. This challenging of basic assumptions is essential for breakthroughs... Progress in understanding requires that we challenge basic assumptions about how the world is and why it is that way."
  * Perceive _reality_. Face inconsistencies. It can be unpleasant. But it is necessary.

## Chapter 1

* Alex Rogo complains about Bill Peach parking in his spot. Then Rogo parks in the _controller's_ spot. He causes the same problem Peach caused for him to someone else. Creates a compounding negative effect.
* Rogo: "...some hourly guy" 
  * Lack of knowledge of plant operations.
* Rogo: "I don't even know what the situation is ... but there must be some kind of emergency. Doesn't that seem logical?"
  * To Alex, this may seem "logical". But it isn't a fundamental truth, or objective reality. 
  * If you admittedly _don't know_ what the situation is, how can you draw conclusions about it?
* "Going into the plant is like entering a place where satans and angels have married to make a kind of gray magic"
  * Likely problematic that the operation being managed seems like "magic" to the manager -- or at least problematic if decisions are being made by that manager in isolation.

## Chapter 2

* Rogo "automatically" compliments his wife's hair -- he's not paying attention, not present, not participating in _reality_. 
* When Rogo mentions to Julie that the plant may close, he notes "her face changes. Did it brighten?" Julie would actually be happier if the plant closed -- her life would be better. Rogo's management of the plant is not only causing him problems, it is making the lives of those around him worse.
* "There is hardly anybody working in the departments that doesn't have something to do with [order] 41427. Donovan has stolen everybody he could grab and put them all to work on this order. This is not the way it's supposed to be done." (p.15)
  * _Why_ is this not the way it should be done? If there's a bottleneck, could it actually be more efficient to have _everyone_ servicing the bottleneck? 
  * Could Rogo be confusing the way he's always done it, with how it should be done?
* Donovan: "Thanks, but don't ask me how we did it."
  * You should know how you did it. Probably everyone involved should.
* Order got out the door, but Rogo says it can't happen that way again, because of "efficiencies". 
  * Decision based on assumptions and metrics that are detached from actual productivity. If efficiencies are lower but you shipped stuff, and when efficiencies are higher you don't ship stuff, maybe you shouldn't be using efficiencies as a measurement.
* "Every six months it seems like some group from corporate is coming out with some new program that's the latest panacea to all our problems"
  * Why is corporate making production decisions?
    * Do they have enough production knowledge to make production decisions?
    * How is corporate reconciling its own metrics? e.g., they measure "efficiencies" -- how do they correlate efficiencies with the goal of the corporation? 
* Everyone acknowledges inventories are piling up -- yet still on and on about "efficiencies", i.e. reducing cost per part. Ignoring the goal. 
* Rogo: "Just about every other plant in America has work-in-process inventory on the same scale that we have"
  * Why does that matter? It's OK for your plant to bleed money, as long as the other plants around you bleed money too?
* Rogo: "I worked hard ... worked hard ... worked hard"
  * Alex is used to brute-forcing his way through life, and it has usually worked for him. Now the complexity of the situation means working hard isn't enough. Needs to change how he approaches reality. 

## Chapter 3

* Rogo: "I'm always running so hard that I don't have time to pay attention to all the daily miracles going on around me."
  * Brute forcing, work hard attitude prevents focus and presence. Can't see reality when you are living in one of your own construction.
  * Take action at all costs! Work hard! Move move move! 
* Rogo completely checked out in the budget meeting -- what's the point? 

## Chapter 4

* Rogo: "I have this tendency (which I've never been able to bring under control) of filling silence in a conversation with my own voice." (p. 27)
  * Ties in to brute-force mentality. Always doing something for the sake of doing something leaves no time for _thinking_, for perceiving reality. 
* Alex is proud of his robots and the fact that they've increased "efficiencies" by 36%. Jonah points out that the robots have increased inventory, sales have not increased, and operational expense has increased -- so the robots have actually caused the plant to _lose money_. 
  * Alex is managing by a metric that is disconnected from the goal of the company.
* Jonah functions as a conduit of objective reality to Alex. Alex tells Jonah his perception of plant operations, Jonah mirrors that perception back and points out its inaccuracy. 
* Rogo: "[Jonah] looks me straight in the eye. He knows what's going on, I'm thinking." (p. 30)
  * Rogo's ego is in the way of seeking better performance. "He knows what's going on" -- well, that implies that so do you. Why resist acknowledging the problem, and seeking a solution? It's OK for the robots or efficiencies to have been a mistake. 
* Jonah: "Alex, if you're like nearly everybody else in this world, you've adopted so many things without question that you're not really thinking at all." (p.31)
* When asked to define productivity, Alex "wonders what [Jonah] want's to hear" 
  * Trying to give people the answers they want to hear is part of the problem. Jonah acknowledges this next.
* Jonah: "Productivity is the act of bringing a company closer to its goal. Every action that brings a company closer to its goal is productive. Every action that does not bring a company closer to its goal is not productive." (p.32)

## Chapter 5

* "You're just playing games with numbers and words." 
  * Everyone in Peach's meeting is talking in terms of metrics that are disconnected from the actual operations of the plant. The metrics being discussed also are not connected to the goal of the company. People are "playing games", not managing a company.
* The people in Purchasing optimize for their _own_ goal. They buy as much stuff as possible as cheaply as possible. Even if that causes inventories to pile up and moves the company away from the goal.
  * _Local optimization_, rather than global. 

## Chapter 6

* Workers reading newspapers because they have nothing to do due to bottlenecks behind them -- they scurry around pretending to work when Rogo walks by. 
  * Indicates disconnection and lack of respect between management and workers. Also an obvious sign of inefficient ops.
* "The basic assumption [of plant management] has been just keep everybody and everything working all the time", regardless of _what_ they are working on.
  * This mirrors Rogo's personal work ethic: work hard, all the time, brute force. Thus it isn't surprising that ops reflect that ethic. It's the way Alex has always done things. 
* "Practically everything [in the plant] is **variable**. The complexity in this plant -- in _any_ manufacturing plant -- is mind-boggling if you contemplate it. Situations on the floor are always changing. How can I possibly control what is going on?"
  * Alex hitting on ops management concepts -- variability, controls. 
  * Alex acknowledges that every manufacturing plant is complex. By his own logic, since there do exist efficiently-managed plants in the world, his conclusion (the plant is too complex to manage) doesn't follow. 
* "He's a fairly bright guy, Lou. You don't have to explain every little thing to him... Lou gets a gling in his eye like I'm real dumb... Lou actually is a bright guy. We're all fairly bright; UniCo has lots of bright, well-educated people on the payroll ... I wonder why it is that we're slipping minute by minute toward oblivion, if we're really so smart." (p.46-9)
  * Rogo is really hung up on "smartness" as an _identity_. Confuses _identity_ (ego) with action (achieving the goal). Being "smart" isn't a step towards the goal, and getting hung up on it may actually be a hindrance.
* "how do I build a direct connection between the three measurements [net profit, return on investment, cash flow] and what goes on in my plant?"
  * Start by observing reality in the plant.

## Chapter 7

* "I slowly realize that the only tools I have -- limited as they may be -- are my own eyes and ears, my own hands, my own voice, my own mind." (p.54)
  * Alex beginning to see reality -- to pay attention to his experience and perception of the world.

## Chapter 8

* The goal: making money. (Jonah)
  * Can be "expressed in different ways"
  * Conventional measurements (e.g. net profit, return on investment, cash flow) don't lend themselves well to the daily operations of a manufacturing plant.
    * So the challenge is to reconfigure the _expression of the goal in terms of operational concerns_. 
* 3 measurements:
  1. **Throughput**: the rate at which _the system_ generates _money_ through sales.
    * Apply to software: is there any limit to this? In manufacturing, you can only sell what you produce. In software, you can effectively produce copies of software infinitely with no increase in cost. 
  2. **Inventory**: all the _money_ that _the system_ has invested in purchasing things it intends to sell.
  3. **Operational expense**: All the _money_ that _the system_ spends to turn inventory into throughput. 
* Jonah: "Just remember we are always talking about _the organization as a whole_ -- not about the manufacturing department, or about one plant or about one department within the plant. _We are not concerned with local optimums._"

## Chapter 9

* Fran: "Bob Donovan wants to know if we can ship without testing." Alex: "Tell him absolutely not." 
  * Is it possible that shipping without testing is the correct decision in some cases though? Especially when the plant is on the verge of being shut down, i.e. very much needs money?
* Each of the 3 questions Jonah asked Rogo corresponds to a measurement: 
  1. "Have you sold more?": throughput
  2. "Did you reduce payroll?": operational expense
  3. "Did inventories go down?": inventory.
* "Increase throughput while simultaneously redducing both inventory and operational expense."
* Rogo: "We haven't been managing according to the goal."
  * Team was trying to optimize "efficiencies" (cost per part); this _directly lead_ to producing more parts than needed; which lead to inventory backlogs; which lead to increased operational expenses. So the "efficiencies" gained by robots moved the plant in direct opposition to the goal of the company.
    * The _management decision_ to introduce the robots and measure "efficiencies" _directly lead_ to the plant losing money. 

## Chapter 10

* Discussion about whether _knowledge_ is inventory or operational expense
  * If used to create a new manufacturing process -- anything that helps turn inventory into throughput -- then it is _operational expense_. 
  * If intended to sell the knowledge, then _inventory_. 
  * If knowledge pertains directly to the product UniCo will build, then it is like a machine -- part inventory, part operational expense.
    * _Inventory_: the present value of the knowledge.
    * _Operational expense_: the depreciated value of the knowledge.
