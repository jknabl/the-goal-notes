# Chapters 31-40

## Chapter 31

* Bill Peach skips plant evaluation, asks Hilton Smyth to evaluate by proxy
* Alex needs to _communicate_ why the fundamentals of traditional cost accounting aren't correct (in context of the production plant)
  * It isn't enough to just do the implementation and hope everyone will love the results -- still resistance from those invested in organizational inertia. 
* Balance _flow_ with demand, _not_ capacity. 
* An individual's performance within a system is not a function of their own potential; rather, it is a function of the overall system bottleneck. 
* Alex gets promoted to Peach's job
* Jonah: "Good luck." Alex: "I'm worried luck isn't enough"
  * Next Goldratt book: "It Ain't Luck"
* Jonah: learn to rely more on _yourself_ as you take on more responsibility. Don't _depend_ on me to think things through for you. 
  * First principles. Ask questions.

## Chapter 32

* If something seems like "common sense", why is it that we often don't recognize it as such except in retrospect?
  * Alex: Jonah's "socratic method" is what enabled us to arrive at the truth.
    * Questioning, thinking.
* Giving answers or The Truth is not the way to persuade someone of something. 
* The process of questioning as the fundamental part of overcoming resistance to change.
* Alex's Q: Jonah is a physicist who hasn't ever worked in a plant. How does he know how to optimize a plant?

## Chapter 33

* Inventory being reported as _assets_ -- but everyone agrees that inventory is a liability. 
  * Reducing inventory artificially penalized the plant in its financials. It regestered as a decrease in assets, making overall performance look like it _decreased_. 
  * Lou: "Everyone evaluates inventory this way... so you have no chance of changing the exec's minds about it ... so I didn't tell you before your meeting!
    * Clever tactic
* Lou: "I've seen myself as an objective provider of data and numbers...but really I was blindly following convention and established procedures.
* Bob: we won the Butnside deal because we listened, thought about unconventional ways to accomplish it, and came up with a feasible compromise. Didn't just say "yes" or "no" blindly up front and hope for the best.
  * Taking initiative. How to incorporate taking initiative _into a process_ and standardize?
* Data is different from information. Signal v. noise. 

## Chapter 34

* Meeting with managers to collectively arrive at "management techniques" under the new system
  * Group involvement. Collective questioning.
* "The safety of being part of a herd," I think to myself; the blame will not be aimed at anyone in particular. (Alex)
* "Overconcern about the proper way to arrange things [within a company]" 
  * e.g. constant re-orgs, switching between functional vs. product line organization, etc.
    * Pendulum swings every 5-10 years when people don't know what else to do.
  * As a decision maker, when you don't know what to do, you can DO SOMETHING! ANYTHING! like a re-org
    * But it's not helpful, or addressing any root causes.
* Collecting facts and combing through them for an arbitrary order/pattern is not productive

## Chapter 35

* Mendeleev: revolutionizing the way basic elements are classified
  * Found 1 quantitiative measurement, atomic weight
    * Revealed **intrinsic** order, rather than superimposed an external order on the elements.
* So _how_ to reveal intrinsic order?
  * Scientific method. Find accepted facts, hypothesize cause, get new facts. Repeat.

## Chapter 36

"Start our division on a constant process of self-improvement.
  * "Improvement" must be relative to the goal.
* The process:
  1. _Identify_ the bottlenecks
  2. Decide how to _exploit_ the bottlenecks.
  3. _Subordinate_ EVERYTHING ELSE to _exploiting_ the bottlenecks.
  4. _Elevate_ the system's bottlenecks
  5. If a bottleneck has been broken, repeat from step 1.

## Chapter 38

* With extra capacity the plant demands extra orders. Sales is now the bottleneck.
  * Sales dept. lowering prices to attract more business, now that there is more capacity.
* Lou (accountant): "Try to imagine," he continues, "the reaction of people when I start to explain to them that THEY are the ones who believe too much in cost accounting."
* How to reveal _intrinsic_ order?
  * Scientific method.
    * Start with a fact. Formulate a hypothesis about the cause for the existence of the fact. Test. Results turn into new fundamental facts.
* Julie: "Socratic dialogues have the same IF...THEN structure. But they apply to human behaviour rather than the material world."
  * Socratic dialogue as the scientific method for human behaviour.

> Remember what [Jonah] said? 'I'm not asking you to develop the management techniques, only to determine what they should be'. I'm afraid I'm trying to jump to the next step, to develop them. Determining the management techniques must come from the _need itself_, from _examining how I currently operate_ and then trying to find out how I _should_ operate."
