# Chapters 21-30

## Chapter 21

* Explicitly labelling WIP with priority
  * Avoids miscommunication, keeps people focused on making the right parts.
* Being _very_ specific to workers with instructions about how to handle priority
  * e.g.: "work on the red labelled parts _right away_ means either immediately, or after 30 minutes of winding down your current task". 
    * No room for interpretation -- good.

##  Chapter 22

* Making small improvements incrementally
  * Process
    * Improved labelling 
    * Covering lunch breaks on setups when they are the bottleneck.
  * Capacity
    * Re-acquiring an old machine to add capacity

## Chapter 23 

* Collecting metrics
  * Predictions based on metrics collected from the bottleneck
* OK to shift labour to a bottleneck if the increased labour cost is justified by the increased throughput.
* Labour working non-bottlenecks has _excess capacity_
  * Can be moved to help on bottlenecks.
* Small process improvements at the bottleneck (pre-sorting and stacking inputs)
  * Continuous improvement
* Choosing to bypass "engineering change orders" to move faster
  * Breaking rules where it results in increased throughput
    * Moving towards the goal justifies breaking rules?

## Chapter 25

* Bottlenecks vs. non-bottlenecks
  * Non-bottlenecks should not always be working, if limited by a bottleneck.
  * The bottleneck is _always_ the throughput constraint in the system.

## Chapter 26

* Have the bottleneck emit a _heartbeat_ that non-bottlenecks use to manage pace of work
* "Tie everyone together": i.e., link all nodes in a system together with some kind of rate-limiting mechanism. 
* "Tie a rope" from the bottleneck to the non-bottleneck at the front
  * Limit the front non-bottleneck to the bottleneck's throughput
* _Signals_ to link processes
  * What are these in SDLC? Review requests, design reviews, ...?
* If you know average setup and process times for each part, you can predict when a batch will clear the bottleneck.
  * ...then once you know whether bottleneck parts will reach assembly, you can work backwards  to determine a release schedule for non-bottlenecks.
  * Has the same effect as moving bottlenecks to the head (first stage) of production. 
  * So e.g. the closer to to the head of production you can move QA, the easier it is for the system to cope with it as a constraint.

## Chapter 27

* "We've broken too many rules to tell [the boss] about them now"
* Julie thinks Alex is a workaholic
  * "Because that's how I grew up" --> That's the way we've always done it.
* Julie asking what _the goal_ of the marriage is.
  * Theory of constraints applied to non-production systems?

## Chapter 28

* Cut batch sizes
* Reduce total time a piece of material spends in the plant.
* 4 phases
  1. Setup time
  2. Process time
  3. Queue time
  4. Wait time

## Chapter 29

* Large batch sizes are inefficient and can cause idleness on non-bottlenecks as they wait for inputs from other non-bottlenecks.
* Small batch sizes lead to more consistent flow between non-bottlenecks.
* Large batch sizes transform non-bottlenecks into temporary bottlenecks. 

## Chapter 30

* Hilton Smyth making a video in the plant about efficient robots -- with the robots sitting idle
  * What is working _efficiently_ might not _look_ like it is working efficiently. Image is not reality.
* H! discovers the new strategy for which Alex et. al. didn't ask permission to implement
