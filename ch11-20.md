# Chapters 11-20

## Chapter 11

* The only way to have excess inventory is to have excess manpower
  * If some people are producting things that stockpile, they are doing wasteful work.
* _Balanced plant_: each resource produces exactly in balance with market demand.
  * A perfectly balanced plant will go bankrupt -- no cashflow.
* "The goal is not to reduce operational expense by itself. The goal is not to improve one measurement in isolation. The goal is to reduce operational expence AND reduce inventory while simultaneously increasing throughput." Johah p. 87
* _Dependent events_: an event that must take place before another can begin.
* _Statistical fluctuations_: Events that can only be predicted probabilistically. 
* Don't consider dependent events or statistical fluctuations alone. Consider them _together_. 
  * Statistical fluctuations have a compounding effect on all dependent events downstream.

## Chapter 12

* Alex: "Julie, you've got no idea what kind of problems I've got at the plant."
  * Julie: "And you have no idea what it's like here at home."  
    * To both:wWhy not _communicate about them_? Mirrors lack of communication in the plant.

## Chapter 13

> Our hike is a series of dependent events ... In combination with statistical fluctuations. Each of us is fluctuating in speed, faster and slower. But the ability to go faster than average is restircted. It depends upon all the others ahead of me in the line." Alex, p.100

> What's happening isn't an averaging out of the fluctuations in our various speeds, but an _accumulation_ of the fluctuations. And mostly it's an accumulation of slowness -- because _dependency limits the opportunities for higher fluctuations_." p.100-1

* Trail analogy
  * Inventory: new materials -- the trail itself, which is "consumed" by the last hiker walking the trail.
  * Throughput: the rate at which the last hiker walks [consumes] the trail.
  * Operational expense: Energy the hikers need to walk the trail.
    * It helps turn inventory (unhiked trail) into throughput.

## Chapter 14

* Dependent events == stages of production.
* Dice game analogy
  * Inventory accumulates, throughput decreases, as the result of compounding differentials in production -- this _accumulates_ through each stage of production.

## Chapter 15 

* **Covariance**: measure of _joint variability_ of two random variables.
  * If an increase in X tracks an increase in Y, covariance is positive. 
  * If an increase in X correlates to a decrease in Y, covariance is negative.

`cov(X, Y) = E|(X - E|x|)(Y - E|y|)|

> In a linear dependency of two or more variables, the fluctuations of the variables down the line will fluctuate around the maximum deviation established by any preceding variables. - p.113

* Helping Herbie (constraint/bottleneck) move faster sped the whole team up. Each individual in the team is a stage in production -- each is a dependent event. 
  * Note: this doesn't always hold in software, e.g. 2 people working on different things.

## Chapter 16

* Julie leaves Alex and the kids. 

## Chapter 17

* The part that Pete's floor workers started off by under-producting for the first 2 hours. This had a compounding effect downstream -- those missed couple hours of production caused everything downstream to be unable to produce, and thus everything downstream was unable to make its tight deadline.
* Pete's people: "We beat the robots!" 
  * Us vs. them mentality probably not productive here. Work with the robots to maximize the plant's throughput. 
* **Covariance**
  * Alex: "The maximum deviation of a preceding operation will become the starting point of a subsequent operation." p.134
* Recognition that the **incentives** were wrong. Pete's floor workers were optimizing for a local maximum -- their own production -- vs. the global system maximum (throughput).

## Chapter 18

* Resources at the _end_ of a system should have a lot more capacity than resources at the start of the system. 
  * "playing catch up"
* 2 types of resources:
  1. Bottlenecks
  2. Non-bottlenecks
* **Bottleneck**: any resource whose capacity is equal to or less than demand placed upon it.
* **Non-bottleneck**: resource whose capacity is greater than the demand placed upon it.
* Don't balance capacity with demand. Rather, balance _flow of product_ through the system with market demand. 
  * "Balance flow, not capacity" p.139
* "Bottlenecks are not necessarily bad -- or good ... they are simply a reality ... where they exist, you must _use them_ to control the flow through the system and into the market." p.139-140
* To find out if we've got [a bottleneck], we concluded we would first have to know the total market demand for products coming out of the plant." p.142
  * Apply to software: do customers actually _want_ the features you are building? Will they really pay for them? If not, then the resource building the feature is doing wasteful work.
* Finding a bottleneck without data, using intuition:
  * Who are the resources who usually "expedite" flow through the system when things fall behind?
  * Which resources are _they_ going to to get what they need to expedite the flow? 
    * This is probably the bottleneck.

## Chapter 19

* Jonah: "Having two bottlenecks doesn't mean you can't make money," he says. "Quite the contrary, in fact. Most manufacturing plants do not have bottlenecks. They have enormous excess capacity but they should have bottlenecks -- one on every part they make." p.151
* NCX-10 machine bottleneck
  * Wasn't working because workers went on break during setup, due to a union agreement that 4 hours work == 4 hours break.
    * Since that downtime results in critical blocking of downstream work, reschedule the workers somehow so they continue setting up the machine uninterrupted. Talk to the union about rearranging the work, since the union has a stake in the plant's success as well.
* Bob: "let's just say our friends in engineering aren't as responsive as they could be ... They're not too happy about changing requirements" 
  * LOL
* Lost time on a bottleneck == lost throughput in the system
  * Quality control _rejecting parts_ is reducing system throughput.
* Make sure bottleneck is _working on good parts_. Move QA closer to the start of the production line. Weed out bad parts before they get to the bottleneck.
  * Software: incomplete/changing requirements == "a bad part" (just like infra features w/ bugs)
* Be sure _process controls_ on bottleneck parts are very good
* How to optimize use of bottlenecks?
  1. Make sure bottleneck's time is not wasterd.
    * Idleness, rework, waste
  2. Make bottlenecks work only on what will contribute to throughput _today_ ... not in the future.
